This library provides an abstraction for building various network topologies such as Spine-Leaf, Fat Tree, and BCube using different link strategies. It is primarily used for creating NS-3 simulator's topology and flow files.
However, it can be extended to create and manage any topology format by extending the link strategy and flow strategies.



## Components

### Topo Builder
